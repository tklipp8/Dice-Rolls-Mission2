This is a dice rolling simulator. This will roll two six sided dies, and give the result of the sum of the two. You will input a number, which is how many times you want the dice to be rolled.
The results of the dice rolling will then be displayed through asterisks. Each asterisk represents one percent of total dice rolls. 

For example, if you enter that you wanted 100 dice rolls, and you rolled the number 6 10 times, it will print 10 asterisks in the 6 row, showing that you rolled the number 6 10% of the time.
